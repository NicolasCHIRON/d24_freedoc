### THP D24 

Learning RoR(Ruby on Rails) and our first database


It's like Doctolib... but better !

* Creating and modeling our models
* Managing migration to play with our tables

## Installation


* 'Git clone' #cloning this repo
* `bundle install` #installing the Ruby's gems


## Usage

* `rails db:migrate` #put all database tables to up status
* `rails db:seed` #generating a random database with faker's gem
* `rails c` #turning on the console

* Do the test `tp City.all `, `tp Patient.all`, `tp Doctor.all`, `tp Appointment.all`, `tp Specialty.all`, `tp CommentLike.all` (or .last)
